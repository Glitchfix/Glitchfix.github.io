      title: Prediction of Human Behavior with TOPSIS
      description: |
        The present paper proposes a new application of the prediction of human behavior using TOPSISas an appropriate tool for data optimization. 
        Our hypothesis was that the analysis of thecandidates with this method was inﬂuenced by the change of their behavior. 
        We found that thebehavior change could occur in more than one time span when the behavior of two candidateschanged simultaneously. 
        One of the advantages of this study is that the pattern of the behaviorchange with time is predicted with this method. 
        Another advantage is that the modiﬁcations inthe TOPSIS algorithm has made the predictions independent from the need of changing thefuzzy membership degrees of the candidates. 
        This is the ﬁrst time that these modiﬁcations inthis technique with a new application including the numerical analysis of cognitive data arereported. 
        Our results can be used in cognitive science, experimental psychology, cognitiveinformatics and artiﬁcial intelligence.

      title: Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms for Proteomic Analysis Using TOPSIS
      description: |
        The present study focuses on a new application of the TOPSIS method for the optimization ofmachine learning algorithms, supervised neural networks (SNN), the quick classiﬁer (QC), andgenetic algorithm (GA) for proteomic analysis. 
        The main hypotheses are that the change in the weights of alternatives could aect the ranking of algorithms. 
        The obtained data conﬁrmed thishypothesis for their ranking. 
        Moreover, adding labor as a cost criterion to the list of criteria did not affect this ranking. 
        This was because candidate 3 had better fuzzy membership degrees thanthe two other candidates concerning their criteria. 
        This work showed the importance of thevalue of the fuzzy membership degrees of the cost criterion of the algorithms in their ranks. 
        The values of the fuzzy membership degrees of the algorithms used for proteomic analysis coulddetermine their priority according to their score differences.
        One of the advantages of this studywas that the studied methods could be compared according to their characteristics. 
        Another advantage was that the obtained results could be related to the new ones after improving these methods. 
        The results of this work could be applied in engineering, where the analysis of proteins would be performed with these methods.
